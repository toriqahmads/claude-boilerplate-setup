  Use when setting up Claude Code in an existing project that already has source
  code, to check whether CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md and related docs match the real codebase
  and fix drift. Also covers "onboard this repo", "sync the docs with the code",
  "audit CLAUDE.md accuracy", "docs are out of date". Triggers on stale docs, missing
  CLAUDE.md, doc/code mismatch, docs lagging recent commits, onboarding an established
  repo.

# Onboarding an Existing Project

## Overview

Make `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md` (and related docs) **accurate and in sync with the real
code** before Claude Code starts working. Read the docs, read the code, compare, then
either propose fixes (docs exist) or create docs (none exist).

**Core rule: never silently rewrite existing docs.** If docs exist and drift from
code, you *propose* — you do not edit them directly.

## Workflow

Do these in order; a todo per step.

1. **Read existing docs.** Look for and read: `CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `context.md`,
   `architecture.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `docs/` (often a folder), progress/roadmap/
   CHANGELOG, `README`. Note which exist. (Setup scopes to docs — it doesn't create or
   sync a project-memory store.)
2. **Analyze the docs.** Extract what they *claim*: architecture, stack, conventions,
   build/test/lint commands, entrypoints, gotchas.
3. **Explore the actual codebase + recent history.** Dispatch Explore subagents;
   traverse the tree, read key files, grep, follow references — read-only, split from
   editing. Cover directory layout, manifests/deps, entrypoints, build & test config,
   dominant patterns. Also read the **latest commits** — `git log --oneline -30`,
   `git log -p -10`, and `git diff` for anything uncommitted — to catch recent changes
   docs may predate (renames, new modules, dropped flags, changed commands).
4. **Analyze the codebase.** Write down what's *actually* true: real structure, stack/
   versions, how to build/test/run, conventions in force. Treat **HEAD + recent
   commits as current truth** — where docs describe an older state, the commits win.
5. **Compare.** Diff steps 1–2 (claimed) against 3–4 (actual + latest commits). List
   every point of drift: wrong/outdated claims, missing commands, undocumented
   modules, dead references, and anything **recent commits introduced or removed**
   the docs don't reflect yet.
6. **Judge sync.** Decide per doc: in sync, or drifted.
7. **If drifted — ask how to deliver, then never silently rewrite.** When `CLAUDE.md`
   already exists and has drifted, **ask the user one question up front** and pick the
   delivery mode from their answer (see "Delivery mode" below):
   - **(A) Local override** — write corrected/added context to `CLAUDE.local.md` at
     the repo root, plus one in **each subdirectory** with its own conventions, and add
     `CLAUDE.local.md` to `.gitignore`. Accurate context immediately, personal and
     uncommitted, without touching the shared committed `CLAUDE.md`.
   - **(B) Proposal doc** — write a **new** `.claude/setup-analysis.md` with (a) drift
     findings, (b) proposed concrete changes per doc (show proposed text/diff). Edit
     nothing else; wait for approval before applying.
   Either way, **never edit the existing committed `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md` directly.**
8. **If docs are missing — create them.** Author `CLAUDE.md` as the canonical file
   (see Setup quality bar), then symlink `AGENTS.md`: `ln -s CLAUDE.md AGENTS.md`. Add
   per-subdirectory `CLAUDE.md` where a module has its own conventions.
9. **Ask when unclear.** Any missing/ambiguous context (intended architecture, why a
   pattern exists, which command is canonical) → ask the user before guessing.
10. **Confirm hooks are active.** SessionStart context, PostToolUse format, Stop
    doc-sync activate automatically once `claude-boilerplate` is enabled — no copy
    step; the format hook auto-detects the project's own formatter (prettier/ruff/
    black/gofmt/…) at runtime, nothing to tailor. See `CLAUDE.md` `## Hooks`.
11. **Confirm MCP servers.** Keyless `context7` + `playwright` + `shadcn` load
    automatically from `.mcp.json`. Offer the **optional** auth servers this repo
    would benefit from — `sentry` (its error tracker), `github`, `figma` — via
    `install.sh` or `claude mcp add -s <scope> …`. See `CLAUDE.md`/`README.md`
    `## MCP servers`.
12. **Offer to install the optional companions** — `bash scripts/install-plugins.sh`
    adds `superpowers` + `ponytail` plugins and the `rtk` CLI/hook (needs `jq`).
    Optional; skills work without them. See `CLAUDE.md` `## Plugins & external
    tooling`.

## Delivery mode (drifted existing docs)

Only when `CLAUDE.md` already exists and drifted (step 7). Ask **before** writing
anything:

> "Docs exist and have drifted. Deliver the corrections as **(A)** local overrides —
> `CLAUDE.local.md` at the root and in each subdirectory with its own conventions,
> added to `.gitignore` (applied immediately, personal, uncommitted) — or **(B)** a
> proposal doc at `.claude/setup-analysis.md` for you to review before anything
> changes?"

- **(A) Local override** — `CLAUDE.local.md` is a Claude-read, git-ignored companion
  to `CLAUDE.md`; layers on top without altering the committed file. Write root +
  per-subdir files, each holding only that scope's corrections/additions. Append
  `CLAUDE.local.md` to `.gitignore` (add if missing; don't duplicate the line).
- **(B) Proposal doc** — the `.claude/setup-analysis.md` report; touch nothing else
  until approved.

Honor a standing user preference without re-asking. Missing docs (step 8) skip this
gate — nothing committed to protect, so create directly.

## Setup quality bar (from official guidance)

- CLAUDE.md = **pointers and critical gotchas only** — "everything else drifts into
  noise." High-level architecture, VCS details, key tooling at root.
- **Layer hierarchically:** root CLAUDE.md for the overview; per-subdir CLAUDE.md for
  local conventions, build/test/lint commands, and deps of that module.
- **Reusable expertise → Skills, not CLAUDE.md.**
- Add `.claudeignore` for generated/build/vendored files; version-control exclusions
  in `.claude/settings.json`.
- Per-subdir test/lint commands to avoid timeouts; add a lightweight codebase map if
  the tree doesn't communicate its own structure.

## Common Mistakes

- Editing an existing committed `CLAUDE.md` directly instead of a `CLAUDE.local.md`
  override (mode A) or `.claude/setup-analysis.md` proposal (mode B).
- Skipping the delivery-mode question and picking A or B yourself when docs drifted.
- Mode A but forgetting to add `CLAUDE.local.md` to `.gitignore` (leaks personal
  context into commits).
- Trusting the docs over the code — code is the source of truth for drift.
- Syncing to an old snapshot — ignoring the latest commits/uncommitted diff.
- Dumping everything into CLAUDE.md instead of pointers + subdir layering.
- Skipping clarification and guessing intent.

## Output

- Docs existed & drifted → **user-chosen delivery**: mode A → `CLAUDE.local.md` at
  root + per-subdir (added to `.gitignore`) carrying doc corrections; or mode B →
  `.claude/setup-analysis.md` proposal covering doc fixes. Committed docs untouched
  either way.
- Docs missing → new `CLAUDE.md` + `AGENTS.md` symlink (+ optional subdir CLAUDE.md).
