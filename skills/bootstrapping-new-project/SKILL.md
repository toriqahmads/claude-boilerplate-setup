description: Use when setting up Claude Code for a new/greenfield project that has no source code yet — only a spec, PRD, plan, brainstorm, or prompt. Triggers on starting from a PRD/Jira/Linear ticket, a plan doc, or a blank repo, to brainstorm intent, write a docs/project-brief.md project brief, and create the initial CLAUDE.md/AGENTS.md. Setup only — it never scaffolds or implements source code; building happens later via planning-work-in-phases.

# Bootstrapping a New Project

## Overview

Stand up the initial `CLAUDE.md` / `AGENTS.md` for a project that has no code yet,
grounded in whatever source of truth exists (spec / PRD / plan / brainstorm). There
is no codebase to analyze — the intent documents and the user are the truth.

**REQUIRED SUB-SKILL:** run `superpowers:brainstorming` before authoring docs — nail
intent and requirements first.

## Scope — setup only, STOP before building

**Core rule: setup ends at docs. It NEVER implements or scaffolds source code.** This
skill produces exactly three artifacts — `docs/project-brief.md`, the canonical
`CLAUDE.md`, and the `AGENTS.md` symlink (plus the hooks/MCP/companion wiring). That is
the whole job.

Do **not** — *even though the repo is greenfield and it feels natural to keep going after
the brainstorm* — scaffold a source tree, create a package manifest (`package.json`,
`pyproject.toml`, `go.mod`, `Cargo.toml`, …), create `src/`/`app/`/`lib/`, install
dependencies, generate boilerplate, or write any application code.

`superpowers:brainstorming` exists to precede *building*; here it precedes only the brief.
When the brainstorm concludes, **write the brief, write `CLAUDE.md`, then STOP.** Building
is a **separate, later, user-initiated** step: the `planning-work-in-phases` workflow
(brainstorm → breakdown → plan → execute → review). Setup seeds that workflow; it does not
run it.

## Workflow

Do these in order. Create a todo per step.

1. **Explore + analyze the source of truth.** Read every intent artifact available:
   brainstorm notes, spec, prompt, PRD (a document, or a Jira / Linear ticket), plan
   doc. Extract: goal, scope, intended stack, constraints, milestones.
2. **Pull more context when detail is missing.** Use available MCP/skills/plugins —
   `WebSearch` for domain/approach, **context7 MCP** (`resolve-library-id` then
   `query-docs`) for any named library/framework/SDK. Do not guess library APIs.
3. **Ask for clarification BEFORE writing.** Any unclear or missing context — target
   stack, non-negotiable constraints, what "done" means — ask the user. Do not invent
   requirements.
4. **Persist the brainstorm to `docs/project-brief.md`.** When
   `superpowers:brainstorming` concludes, write the agreed intent to
   `docs/project-brief.md` — the project-initiation doc a later build reads: goal,
   scope + non-goals, intended stack, constraints, milestones, and open questions.
   **Never overwrite an existing `docs/project-brief.md`** — if one is present, propose
   additions for the user to review instead (same non-overwrite discipline as `CLAUDE.md`).
5. **Confirm the brief + invite additions.** Show the drafted brief to the user, confirm
   it's accurate, and ask whether anything should be added or corrected before setup
   finishes. This brief is the seed for building later, so get it right now.
6. **Create the docs — never overwrite an existing `CLAUDE.md`.** If `CLAUDE.md` is
   **absent**, author it as the canonical file (see Setup quality bar), pointing to
   `docs/project-brief.md` as where the intent / source of truth lives, then make
   `AGENTS.md` a symlink: `ln -s CLAUDE.md AGENTS.md`. If a `CLAUDE.md` already
   **exists** (even in a "new" repo), do **not** overwrite it — propose additions to
   `.claude/setup-analysis.md`, or write a git-ignored `CLAUDE.local.md`, for the user
   to review. Same rule for `AGENTS.md`: never clobber an existing file.
7. **Confirm hooks are active.** The plugin's hooks (SessionStart context, PostToolUse
   format, Stop doc-sync) activate automatically once `claude-boilerplate` is enabled — no
   copy step. The format hook auto-detects the project's formatter (prettier / ruff / gofmt /
   …) at runtime, so style is enforced deterministically from the first commit. See `CLAUDE.md`
   `## Hooks`.
8. **Confirm MCP servers.** The keyless `context7` + `playwright` + `shadcn` load automatically
   from the plugin's `.mcp.json`. Offer to add the **optional** auth servers the project will
   need — `figma`, `sentry` once error tracking exists, `github` for PR/issue flow — via
   `install.sh` or `claude mcp add -s <scope> …`. See `CLAUDE.md` / `README.md` `## MCP servers`.
9. **Install the optional companions.** Run `bash scripts/install-plugins.sh` to add the
   `superpowers` + `ponytail` plugins and the `rtk` token-optimizer CLI/hook (needs `jq`). They
   are optional — the skills work without them. See `CLAUDE.md` `## Plugins & external tooling`.
10. **STOP and hand off — do not build.** Setup is done. Tell the user the repo is set up
    (brief + `CLAUDE.md` + wiring) and that **when they're ready to build**, they run the
    `planning-work-in-phases` workflow (or `superpowers`), which reads `docs/project-brief.md`
    as its starting point. Do **not** begin implementation or scaffolding now — end here.

## Setup quality bar (from official guidance)

- CLAUDE.md = **pointers and critical gotchas only.** At this stage: the goal, the
  intended architecture/stack, key conventions decided so far, and where the source
  of truth (PRD/plan) lives.
- Keep it honest — document decisions made, mark open questions as open. Don't
  document a structure that doesn't exist yet.
- **Reusable expertise → Skills, not CLAUDE.md.**
- Plan to layer per-subdir CLAUDE.md files as the codebase grows.

## Common Mistakes

- **Continuing past setup into scaffolding / implementation** — the single biggest one.
  Setup stops at `docs/project-brief.md` + `CLAUDE.md`; building is `planning-work-in-phases`,
  run later on the user's explicit say-so. Never scaffold a source tree, manifest, or code here.
- Writing CLAUDE.md before intent is clear — brainstorm and ask first.
- Not saving the brainstorm — the brief (`docs/project-brief.md`) is a required output, not
  optional scratch.
- Guessing a library's API instead of using context7.
- Inventing requirements the PRD/user never stated.
- Creating `AGENTS.md` as a separate file instead of a symlink to `CLAUDE.md`.

## Output

Three artifacts, and nothing more:

- `docs/project-brief.md` — the persisted brainstorm / project-initiation doc (goal, scope,
  stack, constraints, milestones, open questions).
- `CLAUDE.md` (canonical) — pointers + gotchas, pointing to the brief as the source of truth.
- `AGENTS.md` — a symlink to `CLAUDE.md`.

**No source code, no scaffold, no manifest.** Built from intent — the code doesn't exist yet,
and this skill doesn't create it. Building is handed off to `planning-work-in-phases`.
